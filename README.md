# Javascript LR Visualizer

> I found this from random link hopping and thought it was quite useful.  It was and still is hosted on the original URL below.  It doesn't look like it supports precedence parsing, and could be improved, but _boy_ is it nice to visualize LR.  
>
> I saved it and placed it here in this [GitHub Repo][1] with the licensed attached so that it it wouldn't be lost to time. â€“ [A.B.][2]
